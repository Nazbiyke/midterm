***This is my try to create a game of life: rock scissors paper. I was scrolling tiktok and I came across a video where a groups of rocks, scissors and papers were moving randomly and the action started happening when they met: scissors that crossed with rocks turned into rocks, when papers met with scissors, they also became scissors and the rocks turned into papers, if they respectively intersected with them. And I have decided to create the simple version of this game. For reference I took the code on ocs, which is given as an example. 

***The rules:
I've marked the rocks in black, the scissors in yellow and the papers in pink. The rules are the same as in the original game: scissors kill paper, papers kill rocks, rocks kill scissors. The essence of my game of life: rock scissors paper is either kill or be killed.. A cell can remain alive in two cases: when the character of the cell is stronger than its neighbor(s), or when it has no neighbor at all.
For instance, scissors die if they have at least one stone-neighbor, and vice versa, scissors kill any paper-neighbor, thereby remaining alive. In another case, when they has no neghbors, they also stays alive (as I said before).***
